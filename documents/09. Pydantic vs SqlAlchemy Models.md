Post

SQLAlchemy Model: Db Model

**Schema/Pydantic Models**

- Define the structure of a request and response
- This ensure that when a user wants to create a post, the request will only go throught if it has 'title' and 'content' in the body
  
[Browser] --Request---> [Schema/ Pydantic Model] ------------> [FastAPI]
[Browser] <------------ [Schema/ Pydantic Model] <--Response-- [FastAPI]

- This ensure the request and response are in a specific model

**SQLAlchemy Models**

- Responsible for defining the columns of our "posts" table within postgres
- Is used to query, create, delete and update enteries within the database
