# 10. Routers

So after cluttering our main.py
We will split the routes or paths to their logical folders


Prefix and tags
- Can be used to group the routes together, instead of writing the route path again and again.
- This can be done by passing a parameter in APIRouter method.
router = APIRouter(
    prefix="/post"
)

so anytime we see a /post we can remove it and it automatically will be taken from the prefix

- Tags will be used to tag the endpoints under a same name or group. (Helpful especially for documentaion).
