# 08. SQLalchemy setup

pip install sqlalchemy
and it also need sql driver
pip install psycopg2

We need to create a file which will handle our connection and that will be named as 'database.py' and will be store inside app folder.

We need to define the connection string for the sqlalchemy for postgresql
`SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://<username>:<password>@<ip-address/hostname>/<database_name>"`

Then we define engine, which is responsible for establishing the connection
But to talk to the database we need to create a **Session**

We then create a Base class which we will be using in our models

Now after this we create models file to create our db model
Where we create model in the following way


from .database import Base
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean

class Post(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'posts'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, nullable=False)
    title = Column(String, nullable= False)
    content = Column(String, nullable= False)
    published= Column(Boolean, default=True)


After this we will change code in main.py
We will add the following lines




models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

app = FastAPI()

## Dependency

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

When fastapi runs it will check if the tables are present against the db if not it will delete the tables.
