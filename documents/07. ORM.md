# 07. ORM

## Object Relational Mapper (ORM)

- Layer of abstraction that sits between the database and us
- We can perform all database operations through traditional python code. No more SQL.


Traditional:
[FastAPI] <-----SQL-----> [DB]

ORM:
[FastAPI] <----python-------[ORM]--psycopg + sql --------> [DB]

## What it can do ?

- Instead of manual defining tables in postgres, we can define our tables as python models
- Queries can be made exclusively through python code. No SQL in necessary

SQLAlchemy

Sqlalchemy is one of the most popular python ORMs
It is a standalone library and has no assosciation with FastAPI.
It can be used with any other python web frameworks or any python based application.
